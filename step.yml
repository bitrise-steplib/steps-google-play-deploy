  To use this step:

  1. You have to upload the first apk manually (using the web interface).
    See: https://play.google.com/apps/publish -> All applications -> Add new application

  2. You must link your Google Play Developer Console to an API project.
    See: https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started. Check the __Linking your API Project section__.

  3. Setting Up API Access Clients, using a service account:
    See: https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started. Check the __Using a service account__ section.
    When you create your service account on the google developer console, choose json as `Key Type`.

  4. Grant Access to provide the service account the necessary rights.
    See: https://play.google.com/apps/publish -> Settings -> User account & rights -> Invite new user and give the privileges.
    Due to the way the Google Play Publisher API works, you have to grant at least the following permissions to that service account:
     - Edit store listing, pricing & distribution
     - Manage Production APKs
     - Manage Alpha & Beta APKs
     - Manage Alpha & Beta users

  5. OPTIONAL - Add translations for your Store Listing.
    To allow the step to assign your 'whatsnew' files to the uploaded apk version.
    See: https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3125566?hl=en (Add translations for your Store Listing)

        Path to the APK or App Bundle to deploy.

        You can provide multiple APK paths separated by `|` character.

        Format examples:

    opts:
      title: Expansion file Path
      description: |-
        Path to the expansion file.

        Leave empty or provide exactly the same number of paths as in apk_path, separated by `|` character and start each path with the expansion file's type
        separated by a `:`. (main, patch)

        Format examples:

        - `main:/path/to/my/app.obb`
        - `patch:/path/to/my/app1.obb|main:/path/to/my/app2.obb|main:/path/to/my/app3.obb`

        Or you can set your custom track name as well. 
        
        For example: `pre-release`, or any of your closed track you added in Google Play Developer Console.

  - whatsnews_dir:
    opts:
      title: "Directory of localized whatsnew files"
      description: |-
        Use this input to specify localized 'whatsnew' files directory.

        This directory should contain 'whatsnew' files postfixed with the locale.

        whatsnew file name pattern: `whatsnew-LOCALE`

            |
            + - whatsnew-en-US
            |
            + - whatsnew-de-DE
        ```

        Format examples:

    opts:
      title: "Untrack blocking versions?"
      description: |-
        Should deactivate apks, with lower version code, on lower level tracks?

        E.g.: 
        If you have an __active apk on alpha__ track with version code: `42`.
        And you try to __upload a new version (`43`), to the beta track__, you will see an error:

        `Version 42 of this app can not be downloaded by any devices as they will all receive APKs with higher version codes`

        To avoid this issue set this input to: `"true"` and the step will deactivate every apk with lower version code, on lower level tracks.
      value_options:
      - "true"
      - "false"
      is_required: true
